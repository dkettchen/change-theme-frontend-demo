premise: site about traditionally very masc-branded subject âœ…

two style sheets tho:
    - one that conforms to the expected masc aesthetic âœ…
    - one that is way more femme looking âœ…

html item and js code to switch between the two sheets at a click
    - corresponding emoji buttons âœ… (one for each theme & one for no theme)
    - function to switch based on button press

                    Sport is a form of physical activity or game. 
                    Often competitive and organized, sports use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills. 
                    They also provide enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators. 
                    Many sports exist, with different participant numbers, 
                    some are done by a single person with others being done by hundreds. 
                    Most sports take place either in teams or competing as individuals. 
                    Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; 
                    others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner.  
                    A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament format, 
                    producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games 
                    in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.
